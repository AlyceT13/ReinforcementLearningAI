# Reinforcement Learning Maze Navigation

This project implements two classic reinforcement learning algorithms — **Q-Learning** and **SARSA** — to navigate mazes. The AI learns optimal paths through exploration and reward-based learning in a 2D grid-based map loaded from text files.

## Features

- Q-Learning and SARSA implementations
- Support for multiple maze configurations via `.txt` files
- Simple map visualizer for debugging
- Adjustable learning parameters
- Console-based output showing learning progress
